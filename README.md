In this project, two algorithms are applied to a MATLAB simulation of a mobile robot. Using the robot's sensor measurements and odometry measurements, an occupancy grid was constructed for the purpose of mapping. Also, a particle filter was designed to estimate the location of the mobile robot at each time step. 

To observe the occupancy grid and particle filter algorithms in action, download the results folder. This folder contains error plots as well as .avi files that illustrate the evolution of these two algorithms.
